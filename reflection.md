# Reflection

1. **What is CI and CD?**  
CI (Continuous Integration) is the practice of frequently merging code changes into a shared repository and testing them automatically.  
CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery) ensures that tested changes are automatically released to production or staging environments.

2. **Why is automation important?**  
Automation reduces manual errors, speeds up feedback, ensures consistency, and lets developers focus on building features instead of running repetitive tasks.

3. **How can CI/CD improve teamwork and quality?**  
- Developers see issues early through automated tests.  
- Merges are smoother since integration happens often.  
- Teams collaborate better because everyone trusts that the main branch is always stable.  
- Quality improves since bugs are caught earlier.

4. **Challenges faced**  
- YAML indentation and syntax errors.  
- Understanding GitHub Actions workflow steps.  
- Fixing typos in filenames and ensuring test discovery worked.  
- Debugging failed pipeline runs until it turned green.
